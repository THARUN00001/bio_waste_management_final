                <h3>What is Hospital Waste Management?</h3>
               <p> Hospital waste management, also called medical waste management, is a system that handles the segregation, containment, and disposal of hazardous, hospital-generated, infectious waste.    </p>
            <h3>What Should a Hospital Waste Management Checklist Include?</h3>
         <p>   A medical waste monitoring checklist should ideally specify and include the following information and ensure proper implementation of the following:

            Written management plan,
People responsible,
Appropriate - equipment, materials, and supplies,
Waste management protocols,
Appropriate separation of wastes,
Proper collection and transportation of wastes,
Appropriate storage and disposal of wastes.
</p>           
<h3>Best Practices for Hospital Waste Management

</h3> 
<p>Medical waste such as infectious items, chemicals, expired pharmaceuticals, radioactive items, and sharps (used needles, lancets, etc) are hazardous and, if not properly disposed or treated, can be lethal and a threat to the environment. To achieve safe and sustainable management of medical waste, consider these top 3 best practices:</p>
  <h5>Stay updated on regulations</h5>
  <p>There can be different regulations when it comes to medical waste. Be aware of these regulations and keep track of updates to help maintain the compliance of the medical staff and facility. Provide training and other resources to assist you in implementing proper waste management.</p>
<h5>Color-code containers and waste bins</h5>
<p>Hospital waste disposal involves the proper identification of the different types of medical waste and each type of medical waste requires a different disposal method. Segregating medical wastes based on their type helps ensure that each waste is discarded, transported, and destroyed properly. Waste bin color coding in hospitals help healthcare staff easily segregate waste and identify which waste goes to which container to help prevent issues arising from random or improper disposal.</p>
<p>Red – anatomical (e.g. blood, organs)</p>
<p>Orange – clinical/infectious</p>
<p>Yellow – clinical/highly infectious</p>
<p>Blue – medicines (e.g. unused drugs)</p>
<p>Purple -cytotoxic and/or cytostatic products (e.g. chemotherapy medicines)</p>
<p>Black – municipal waste – ie. not clinical or medical waste</p>
<p>White – dental</p>
<p>Green - Others</p>
